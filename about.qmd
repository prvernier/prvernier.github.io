I am a landscape ecologist with the [Department of Renewable Resources](http://www.rr.ualberta.ca) at the University of Alberta. My research interests include biodiversity monitoring, systematic conservation planning, and species distribution modelling. I am a member of the [BEACONs Project](http://www.beaconsproject.ca/), which is developing a scientific framework for comprehensive conservation planning through the development and application of leading-edge conservation science that includes consideration of both protected areas and lands managed for other values.

In addition to research, I enjoy trail running in the coastal mountains and forests of British Columbia and Washington State as well as the Jura and Alps in France.

Most recent publications are listed on Google Scholar. Otherwise, [here is an older](pubs.html), but more comprehensive, list.
