## Intactness

### Alaska

**Northwest Boreal LCC Anthropogenic Footprint (Geist et al. 2017).** The Northwest Boreal LCC Anthropogenic Footprint maps the human footprint (currently mining) across interior Alaska and northwestern Canada. The map provides a seamless dataset that spanned state, provincial and territorial boundaries to represent an initial look at intactness in the boreal ecosystems of western Canada and Alaska.

**Alaska Landscape Intactness (Trammell and Aisu 2016).** The landscape condition model (LCM) was developed to measure the impact of the human footprint on a landscape. The LCM weighs the relative influence of different types of human activities to arrive at five condition classes ranging for very low (0.0-0.2) to very high (0.8-1.0) impact. The "very low" class combined with the Alaska IFL was then used to derive a landscape intactness dataset.

**Alaska Intact Forest Landscapes (Strittholt et al. 2006).** The Intact Forest Landscapes (IFL) map depicts Alaska's remaining forest landscape fragments using three classes: 5,000-10,000 hectares, 10,000-50,000 hectares, and &gt;50,000 ha. The map was produced using (i) existing datasets describing major anthropogenic changes/disturbances (e.g., roads, other linear features, reservoirs) to exclude large areas influenced by human activities and (ii) satellite imagery (Landsat 5 and 7, 30m) to identify finer scale anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., cutblocks, cutlines) within candidate intact forest landscapes. Note that, similar to the Canada IFL dataset, fires were treated as natural disturbances.

**Alberta Human Footprint (ABMI 2017).** From the ABMI website: "This comprehensive layer (updated every two years) includes human footprint information related to the energy, forestry, and agriculture industries, as well as urban development. The ABMI's human footprint information is core to understanding relationships between human land use, habitat, and species abundance. These data are used to support policy development, regional planning, and cumulative effects management decisions." The Human Footprint Index (HFI) has being developed for 2007, 2010, 2012, 2014.

### Examples of recent remote sensing based disturbance datasets from Canada

Several disturbance datasets have been developed recently, some of which have been used to update both the Canada and Global IFL datasets. The datasets represent changes in forest cover with or without attribution to disturbance type.

**Global maps of forest cover change (Hansen et al. 2013).** The maps were developed using Landsat imagery at a resolution of 30m and covers latitudes 80N and 60S. Four metrics are used: (i) percent tree cover in 2000, (ii) cover loss 2000-2012, (iii) cover gain 2000-2012, and (iv) year of cover loss. There is no attribution of disturbance type. The datasets was recently updated to 2015.

**Annual mapping of large forest disturbances in Canada (Guindon et al. 2014).** Annual mapping of large forest disturbances across Canada's forests using 250m MODIS imagery from 2000 to 2011. At total of 22 raster maps were generated representing fractional change and disturbance type. Fractional change is mapped as a continuous variable at the pixel level. Disturbance types were classified as no-change, fire, harvesting, or flooding.

**Canada Landsat Disturbance (CanLaD) 2017.** This dataset includes a set of raster maps in which areas affected by fire or by harvest from 1984 to 2015 are identified at the level of individual 30m pixels on the Landsat grid. Details of the product development can be found in Guindon et. al. (2017, 2018).

**Satellite forest monitoring in Canada (White et al. 2017).** Online satellite-derived forest change map for Canada with information on the amount, type, and rates of disturbances from 1985-2011. The maps were developed using Landsat imagery at a resolution of 30m and estimate change type as being fire, infrastructure, harvest, or untyped.

**Northwest Boreal LCC Anthropogenic Footprint (Geist et al. 2017).** Datasets representing past and present human footprint across the Northwest Boreal Landscape. Currently, only the mining footprint layer is available. It was created by digitizing visible mining footprints using best available digital imagery layers (primarily GeoNorth Ortho WMS layer and ESRI global imagery service) and represents a snapshot in time during the period between 2010-2016.
